    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this assignment is to appropriately configure a raspberry pi 4. This assignment works to establish a remote connection an personalized settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment took longer than the 2-3 hour time prediciton. This is my first exposure really to using Linux, C, and a raspberry pi. Due to my lack of original knowledge, this assignment took approximately 8 hours. \n",
    "\n",
    "From this assignment I learned how to establish public servers, basic set up for the raspberry pi, simplistic basics of C and C structure, as well as learned how to remote into raspberry pi for PC/pi communication (including file sharing)."

    "## Procedure and Respective Lessons Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Comments Needed Prior to Set Up\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important commands with sudo hault to turn the raspberry pi off safely. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process was greatly simplified using the SD card provided by CanaKits that was preloaded with the NOOOBS software. This allowed for a seamless initial set up. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the board was powered on, \"Raspberry Pi OS Full (32-bit) [RECOMMENDED]\" was selected for installation as shown below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"selectOS.jpg\" alt=\"selectOS\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Set Up\n",
    "\n",
    "This intallation took several minutes. Installing this OS prompted several initial set up phases that were very easy to change such as location, time-zone, password, and wifi. Following the launch of the OS two commands were run in the terminal (key located in the upper left side of the GUI):\n",
    "\n",
    "* sudo apt update\n",
    "* sudo apt upgrade\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that the software found on the board is up-to-date and ready to use. From here, I continued to the more advanced portion of the system set up. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most all other features were changed in the raspberry pi configuration page which can be accessed using the following command: \n",
    "\n",
    "* sudo raspi-config\n",
    "\n",
    "Under advanced settings the console autologin can be established and the host name can be changed. The host name that I selected for my device is \"combspi4\" which incorporates my last name. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"changeHostName.jpg\" alt=\"changeHostName\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all of the basics were set, I worked to establish a connection with my macbook pro. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication with Raspberry Pi\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checking Network Connection of the Raspberry Pi\n",
    "\n",
    "This task was very simple as I had NOOBS installed on the micro SD card. Part of the installation process ensures that you are connected to a viable internet source via wifi. The GUI that runs on the device also has an easy to locate wifi connection in the top right side. \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that the Pi is connected: \n",
    "\n",
    "ping combspi4.local\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to ensure that the device is connected to the network is by checking to see all connected devices to the router. The below information was displayed:\n",
    "\n",
    "192.168.0.20 is the IP address for the combspi4 \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing ssh\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that ssh has not been previously installed the following command was run to check. In conclusion, ssh was not installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* sudo service --status-all\n",
    "\n",
    "ssh was enabled in the raspberry pi configurations page under interface options. To enable ssh, I toggled the enable button and checked the status. \n",
    "\n",
    "On my mac, I then used the following command to remote into the raspberry pi. This allows for use in the terminal on the raspberry pi or using ssh -y pi@combspi4.local on a PC. \n",
    "\n",
    "* (base) Julias-MacBook-Pro-30:~ juliacombs$ ssh -y pi@combspi4.local\n",
    "\n",
    "I then created a folder for the class in the directives on the raspberry pi from my PC. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: use mkdir [file name] to create a new file on the raspberry pi. \n",
    "\n",
    "I created a file called eep522 at the address /home/pi/eep522 on the raspberry pi. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing and Using samba\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the topic that I spent most of my efforts on. I did not know anything about this topic. I had to learn how to file share from my mac which can be found in the \"sharing\" folder in the system settings. Under the advanced setting, I was able to change my ability to use ssh on my mac and make folders public. I have never used a public folder on my mac so this was all a learning experience that took longer than expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing Samba:\n",
    "\n",
    "To install samba on the raspberry pi the following command was used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* pi@combspi4:~ $ sudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin\n",
    "\n",
    "The installation of samba was verified and located using the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "* pi@combspi4:~ $ sudo /etc/init.d/smbd status\n",
    "* pi@combspi4:~ $ whereis samba\n",
    "\n",
    "The location of the samba is: samba: /usr/sbin/samba /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/samba /etc/samba /usr/share/samba /usr/share/man/man8/samba.8.gz /usr/share/man/man7/samba.7.gz\n",
    "\n",
    "After samba was verified, I changed the password on my samba using the command below. This allows for me to gain access the raspberry pi as a shared server.\n",
    "\n",
    "* sudo smbpasswd -a\n",
    "\n",
    "I then signed into the raspberry pi established server from my mac. This is where I ran into my largest issue. I was unable to share files between my mac and the raspberry pi. The solution was adjust the configuration of the same to make sure that I could read and write to the shared folder that I wanted. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the command use to access the samba configuration: \n",
    "\n",
    "* pi@combspi4:~ $ sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the modifications I made that allowed me to file transfer. I am not sure if this is the most efficient way, but after reading several articles and trial and error, this was the solution that allowed me to transfer files succesfully. I changed [home] to read only = no and add the below code:\n",
    "\n",
    "[eep522]\n",
    "\n",
    "   path = /home/pi/eep522\n",
    "   \n",
    "   read only = no\n",
    "   \n",
    "   browsable = yes\n",
    "   \n",
    "I also uncommented this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "[netlogon] \n",
    "\n",
    "   comment = Network Logon Service\n",
    "   \n",
    "   path = /home/samba/netlogon\n",
    "   \n",
    "   guest ok = yes\n",
    "   \n",
    "   read only = no\n",
    "\n",
    "From here I was able to drag and drop files in the shared folder and watch them appear in the GUI files on the raspberry pi monitor. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning C\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment exposed me to C for the first time. I was able to download visual studios and began to learn the basic code structure that C uses. Here I wrote a basic \"Hello World\" script. I did this prior to looking at Section 8 of A1. \n"

    "\n",
    "From this assignment I am learning to understand the capabilities of the raspberry pi and frankly on my own computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to expand on this knowledge with help from the \"Exploring Raspberry Pi: Interfacing to the real world with embedded Linux\" by Derek Molloy. Following the examples from this book, I was able to play around with turning on basic components (i.e. servo, LED) directly from the terminal. "
